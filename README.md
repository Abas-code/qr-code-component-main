## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to make variables for different CSS styling through this project.

```css
:root { --colorOne: #ffffff; --colorTwo: #d6e2f0; --colorThree: #68778d; --colorFour: #1f3251; }

body { overflow: hidden; background: var(--colorTwo); font-family: 'Outfit'; }
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus on newer and simpler ways of structuring and styling web pages in future projects. I will also take up a Javascript course.
